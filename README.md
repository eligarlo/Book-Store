# Book-Store


## Prepared Statements

1. Create a database called **book_store**:
   - Create a table named **books** with the following columns:
     - **book_id** (int, primary key, auto increment)
     - **book_name** (string)
     - **author** (string)
     - **price** (decimal size 5.2)

2. Create a page that allows you to:
   - add a book 
   - update a book 
   - delete a book 
   - view the list of all books

Work according to the layer model.
All of the above should be done by Prepared Statements.
